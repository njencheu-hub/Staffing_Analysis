**Report Summary**

***Executive Summary***
In our analysis of Q2 2024 PBJ Nurse Staffing Data, we uncovered staffing trends with direct implications for Clipboard Health’s growth strategy:

Vermont leads all states with a 29.5% average contractor staffing rate, followed by Maine, Montana, and North Dakota.

New York facilities dominate the top of the census rankings, with several operating at 500+ daily patients and using 30%+ contractors — ideal targets for Clipboard’s contractor services.

A focused list of high-opportunity facilities was generated, based on large census size and high reliance on contractor hours.

***Strategic Recommendations***
1. Prioritize Sales Outreach in Vermont and the Northeast
Vermont’s contractor usage is nearly 2x the national average, suggesting strong demand and limited internal staffing capacity.

2. Target Large, Contractor-Reliant NY Facilities
Facilities like Workmens Circle and Isabella Geriatric show large patient volumes and high contractor use — prime targets for Clipboard’s full-service offerings.

3. Develop Regional Playbooks for High-Risk Facilities
Build region-specific campaigns highlighting Clipboard’s rapid placement capabilities to facilities exceeding 30% contractor reliance.
